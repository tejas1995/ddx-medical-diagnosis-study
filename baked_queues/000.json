The patient experiences a fast and irregular heartbeat, palpitations, anxiety, and dizziness, which are hallmark signs of PSVT. The regular consumption of stimulant drugs and energy drinks can trigger or exacerbate PSVT episodes, further supporting this diagnosis. Additionally, the absence of pain and recent travel history reduces the likelihood of other conditions such as scombroid",

These substances can mimic or exacerbate heart-related symptoms, making it challenging to definitively attribute the patient's condition to PSVT without further diagnostic testing like an ECG."
