The absence of pain and the regular consumption of caffeine and energy drinks could act as potential triggers for PSVT episodes, further supporting this diagnosis. Unlike anemia, which typically presents with fatigue and other systemic symptoms, or scombroid food poisoning, which often involves gastrointestinal issues",
        "ai_contrastive_explanation": "While I think Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) is the correct diagnosis due to the symptoms of palpitations and dizziness, it may not be the correct diagnosis because these symptoms can also be caused by excessive caffeine intake from coffee, tea, and energy drinks. Additionally, PSVT is typically associated with more sudden onset episodes, whereas the patient's symptoms could be more chronic and related to lifestyle factors. Therefore, it is possible that the symptoms are not indicative of a cardiac issue but rather a result of stimulant consumption."
