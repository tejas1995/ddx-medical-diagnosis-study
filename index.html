            <div id="instructions_0">Welcome to our user study. You will be trying to answer questions with the assistance of an AI system. We will first walk you through an example question with
                images and afterwards you will annotate 30 examples.</div>
            <div id="instructions_1">
                Each example consists of a <b>question</b> and <b>two options</b>. The question will involve scientific knowledge.

            <div id="instructions_2">
                In the first step, you must select the option you think is correct, based on your own knowledge. You must also mark your confidence in your answer.

                After your decision, you will be shown a predicted answer from an AI system, along with a confidence score (out of 100). <br>
                Based on the AI system's prediction and confidence, you must select the option that you now think is correct, along with your confidence in the selected answer.

            <div id="instructions_4">
                You will then get to see if your final answer and the AI system's prediction were correct or not. <br> 
                If your final answer was correct, you will receive a reward of $0.10. If your final selection was incorrect, you will not receive a reward. <br>
                The guaranteed minimum is $1.0 regardless of your performance, but you can earn more money if your answers are correct (the additional money will be paid out as bonuses on Prolific).

                Finally, you will decide how much you trust the AI to help you with this task, on a scale from 0 to 100. <br>
                This trust will be based on the interactions you have had with the AI system so far. <br>
                After selecting a trust level, you can move on to the next question.
